# JavaGame

/*

My first completed project that was finished a year ago.

The project consists of my first time using java on properitery software called "processing" (then later eclipse).
It also introduced me to the concepts of classes , constructors (made my head spin ngl), methods, polymorphism, etc.
At the time the project took me a while to finish as I was freshly introduced to the programming language and coding concepts.
Looking back, I can see alot unrefractured code (spaghetti code), meaningless classes and a better general way to complete the project in a smaller time-frame
After this self-diagnosis I can only be grateful for attempting and finishing this project as It was a platform to get me where I am now.

Thanks for reading!.
